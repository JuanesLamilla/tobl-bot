# TOBL-Bot

TOBL-bot is soon to be updated and properly documented, in order to make the code open source. This project was the first larger scale python projects I took on individually, so I would like to properly document and tidy up the code before releasing it publicly. The README below is just a template soon to be updated.

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install foobar.

```bash
